        <title>Information Gathering â€“ Child Support Enforcement</title><para id="eip-842">The unique nature of child support enforcement cases requires that a PNC provide enough information for the attorney to determine with reasonable certainty (a) the extent of any violations of the child support order, and (b) the viability of any defenses to the arrearages and contempt<footnote id="fn-defenses">For a partial list of defenses to the enforcement of a child support order, see section 157.008 of the Texas Family Code.</footnote>.</para><section id="import-auto-id1167592353932">

          <title>Additional Information</title><para id="import-auto-id1167592371406">The PNC may or may not have access to this information at the time he or she contacts your office. If the PNC has the information, then record it on the intake form. If the PNC does not have the information, then emphasize to the PNC that it is very important that he or she bring that information to the initial consultation.
          </para><list id="import-auto-id1167600381693" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item><emphasis effect="italics"><term>CIN</term> and <term>PIN</term></emphasis>. The Texas Attorney General Child Support Division maintains a website that enables an <term>obligee</term>, obligor, or attorney to login and obtain detailed, court-admissible child support payment records. To use this web site, the attorney either needs to send a letter of representation to the <term>OAG</term> or have one of the parents' CIN/PIN combination. Because there can be considerable delay to the OAG processing a letter of representation, it is easier to use the client's PNC's CIN/PIN combination.
           <newline/></item>

           <item><emphasis effect="italics">Expected Amount of Arrearage.</emphasis> It's a good idea to find out how much the PNC thinks is owed in unpaid child support. The attorney will calculate the exact amount owed, but it is helpful to be able to compare the attorney's computed figure to the PNC's expectations.<newline/></item>

<item><emphasis effect="italics">Type of Support.</emphasis> Court orders can contain many payment provisions that are to be treated as child support. Some of those payment provisions require that the payments be made through the <term>CSDU</term>. Payments made through the CSDU are usually limited to periodic payments of a fixed amount such as regular child support and reimbursement for medical insurance premiums. Other child support payments for which the amount would vary and for which the periodicity of the payment is irregular, such as reimbursement for the reasonable and necessary medical expenses that are incurred or paid on behalf of the child or payment for extracurricular activities, are not paid through the CSDU and therefore a court-admissible payment record will not be readily available. Dealing with arrearages on support payments that should be paid through the CSDU is simpler than dealing with arrearages on child support payments that are paid directly to the obligee and therefore the fees quoted by the attorney will be different.<newline/></item>

<item><emphasis effect="italics">Whether there have been any direct payments.</emphasis> Some obligors do not pay their child support through the CSDU, even if it is a type of payment that should be paid through the CSDU and even if they have been ordered to do so. The attorney will need to know whether the direct payment of child support from the obligor to the obligee is an issue. Proving a payment history, particularly in defending against a child support enforcement suit, requires more effort and expenses.<newline/></item></list><para id="eip-102">With this information, the attorney will be able to estimate the complexity of the case and be prepared to quote a fee or set the amount of an initial deposit for legal fees.</para></section>

          <title>Documents for the PNC to Gather and Bring</title><section id="eip-725"><title>Obligee's Documents</title><para id="eip-520">
The obligee, who is the person who would be alleging a violation of the child support order, must supply the following documents at the initial consultation. During the intake call, the person handling the call must provide this list to the PNC.
</para><list id="eip-681" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item><emphasis effect="italics">Court order(s) showing obligation that is to be enforced.</emphasis> If the case comes from a county where the attorney has access to court orders through the District Clerk's web site, the attorney can obtain copies of orders even if the client cannot find them. Even on counties that provide on-line access to court orders, an order might be marked as containing sensitive information<footnote id="fn010">Rule 21c of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure</footnote> and thus be inaccessible. To be safe, ask the client to bring a copy of any order that is to be enforced<footnote id="fn001">Some counties, such as Harris and Dallas provide free public access to all unsealed case files. However, if the order contains sensitive data (see TRCP 21c), it will not be accessible on-line. Other counties like Collin and Tarrant provide fee-based services where subscribers can look up files for any case or, as in the case of Denton County, subscribers can only look up cases on which they are already attorney of record. Finally, there are a great number of lower-population counties that provide no ability to retrieve documents from their web site such as Rockwall and Hunt counties.</footnote>.
            <newline/></item>

            <item><emphasis effect="italics">Evidence of demand for payment.</emphasis> This does not apply to periodic child support paid through the CSDU. This applies to reimbursement for medical expenses, extracurricular activities, etc.

The obligor must bring in several types of documents, depending on the defenses to be raised.
</para><list id="eip-571" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item><emphasis effect="italics">Court order(s) showing obligation that is to be enforced.</emphasis>See discussion above.<newline/></item>

<item><emphasis effect="italics">Evidence of payment.</emphasis> If the obligor is raising the defense that he or she has actually made some or all of the child support payments that are being claimed as arrearages, then the obligor needs to bring copies of all documents, including email messages and text messages, that would tend to prove that he or she actually made payments, whether through the CSDU or directly to the obligee.<newline/></item>

<item><emphasis effect="italics">Detailed evidence of income and assets during the period of nonpayment.</emphasis> If the obligor is raising the defense of being unable to make the payments as ordered, then he or she will need to show paystubs, W-2s and 1099s, tax returns, bank statements, and credit card statements covering the period of alleged nonpayment. The attorney will review these documents to determine whether the obligor was paying to the extent of his or her means. Also, if the obligor tried to borrow money to pay the child support, he or she needs to provide evidence of the loans or attempts to secure loans.<newline/></item></list></section></section>

(NOTE: Bank subpoenas can be a very expensive undertaking.) If the obligee deposited checks or other instruments from obligor, demand copies of those from the obligee through discovery and rely on the self-authentication rules for admissibility. (This also shifts the financial burden of providing records to the obligee, but obligor's attorney must be willing to compel production.)
